# assumptions
# 1. assuming a 3D (x,yz) dataset
# 2. assuming the image contains sub-resolution beads
#    note.  It is expected some beads may "clump" into larger objects,
#    the script may still work under these conditions, but the cleaner the
#    the bead image the better the PSF.
# 3. We use integer locations for bead centroids.  In reality beads are centered
#    at sub-resolution locations.  However as long as we have enough beads the error
#    in position should "even out".

# get dimensions of bead image
xSize=beads.dimension(0)
ySize=beads.dimension(1)
zSize=beads.dimension(2)

# create an empty image to store the points
points=ops.create().img([xSize, ySize, zSize])

# otsu threshold to find the beads
thresholded = ops.threshold().otsu(beads)

# call connected components to label each connected region
labeling=ops.labeling().cca(thresholded, StructuringElement.FOUR_CONNECTED)

# get the index image (each object will have a unique gray level)
labelingIndex=labeling.getIndexImg()

# get the collection of regions and loop through them
regions=LabelRegions(labeling)

for region in regions:

	# get the center of mass of the region
	center=region.getCenterOfMass()

	# place a point at the bead centroid
	randomAccess= points.randomAccess()
	randomAccess.setPosition([long(center.getFloatPosition(0)), long(center.getFloatPosition(1)), long(center.getFloatPosition(2))])
	randomAccess.get().setReal(255.0)

# convert images to float
beads32=ops.convert().float32(beads)
points32=ops.convert().float32(points)

# use "PSF Distilling" (reverse deconvolution) to solve for PSF
psf=ops.deconvolve().richardsonLucy(ops.create().img(beads32), beads32, points32, None, None, None, None, None, 30, False, True)
